# Full Stack Application Pair Project

## Snack-a-log

Create an app that allows users to log their favorite snacks. Add functionality that allows users to see whether or not their snack is healthy based on a simple algorithm.

For this project there are 40 features or functionality to build. To pass this project a minimum of 28 features must be built.

## Overview

- Using a mono-repo template repository, create a full-stack web application
- Use express to build a full CRUD back-end application that adheres to RESTful routes
- Use create-react-app to build a full CRUD front-end application that interacts with the back-end
- Use unit tests to guide the building process
- Deploy the applications online, so anyone can see them online

## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone this repository.

### Back-end setup

It is recommended that you open a new terminal tab that will be dedicated to running and developing your back-end

- `cd back-end`
- `touch .env`

**.env**

```
PORT=3333
PG_HOST=localhost
PG_PORT=5432
PG_DATABASE=snack_a_log
```

- `npm install` - install npm packages listed in `package.json`
- `npm run db:init` - initialize a new database and create tables
- `npm run db:seed` - seed the table(s) with some data
- `nodemon` - confirm that this is running on port 3333
- Visit http://localhost:3333/snacks/ and make sure you see some snack data in the form of an array of objects
- `npm run test` - to run the back-end tests

### Front-end setup

It is recommended that you open a new terminal tab that will be dedicated to running and developing your front-end

- `cd front-end`
- `touch .env`

**.env**
