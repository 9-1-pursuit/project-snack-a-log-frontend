# Working in Groups

A brief tutorial on how to work in groups in the (tech) workplace.

Working in groups is a skill that everyone should practice. Because it is a skill, everyone can learn to collaborate better.

## How to tell if you're working in a group

If the answer to any of these questions is "no," you're probably not working in a group:

- Are you asking and answering questions?
- Are you talking to other people?
- Are you looking at other people/turning on your camera to engage with your group?

## How to create a good group environment

### Before starting the project

- Ask your teammate how they learn best
- Find out what your teammates' interests are outside of class/work
- Ask your teammates what they struggle with/ what challenges they've had
- Ask your teammates what they are good at
- Figure out how you want to approach the project
- On zoom all day long, co-coding all the time?
- Checking in a few times a day, but otherwise working on separate tasks?
- A blend of working together and working independently?
- Understand each other's schedules and outside obligations and make a plan of how the collaboration will work
- Remember that people often need sympathy before advice

### During the Project

#### I understand everything we're supposed to be doing

What should I do?

- Ask your teammates if they have questions
- Ask your teammates how they're doing
- Ask your teammates to walk you through their code/planning process
- Listen to your teammates explain their issues and/or feelings
- Ask your teammates how they feel about the project
- Practice patience

What should I avoid doing?

- Saying "This is easy."
- Telling people not to feel the way they feel

#### I'm confused about what we're supposed to be doing

**What should I do?**

- Ask your teammates to pause what they are doing
- Formulate a clear question about a specific part of the project (I don't understand why my form doesn't work. I have tried this, can you look at it with me?)
- Ask your teammates to walk through the code/planning process
- Tell your teammates how you feel
- If you are far enough behind that catching up would really hold up the project, identify the areas that you need to study, and ask for help/resources to learn that skill
- Don't forget to leverage your own skillset. Perhaps you are skilled at organization, presentations, or communication, you always have something positive to contribute. Talk it out.

**What should I avoid?**

- Panicking. "I can't do this" is less productive than, "I can't do this yet,
  can you help me?"
- Pretending that you understand. This will lead to bigger problems down the
  line.

## Mixed-gender groups

It's [pretty](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2779483?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)
[well](http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/apl/84/4/620/)
[documented](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0022-4537.00233/abstract;jsessionid=DDF6B475A5ADE1E94547F07AD9943C5A.f02t02)
that women often are overlooked in mixed-gender groups. Luckily, you don't have
to be a part of this problem. Here are some ways that you can support the women
in your group.

- Don't interrupt them when they are talking
- Publicly acknowledge the work that they do
- Give them credit for their ideas
- If they haven't spoken in a while, ask them if they have anything to add
- Keep it [PC](http://www.npr.org/2014/12/18/371737257/when-working-in-mixed-groups-staying-p-c-boosts-productivity)

But I'm not one of "those guys!" Great! Women have experienced so many of "those guys" in their lives that unfortunately, you will have to put in some extra effort to make it clear that you're not one of them. Thanks!

## Things to Remember

Working as a team helps everyone, even if (especially if) teammates are on different levels:

More experienced team members:

- Gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter by explaining it to less experienced teammates
- The process of explaining their code will help them better understand and evaluate it
- The skills they are building is improving how they talk about code, leadership, teaching/training others
- They will also start learning how to explain things to people with different learning styles.

Less experienced students:

- Gain a deeper understanding by hearing a fresh explainaition
- Watching how someone else approaches problem solving will help improve their own problem solving skills
- Improving communication and learning to talk about code
- Gaining an improved understanding of how they learn best and what they need in order to successfully work in a group
